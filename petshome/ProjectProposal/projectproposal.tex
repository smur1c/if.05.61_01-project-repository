\section{Introduction}
\begin{explanation}
It's a matter of fact that people like to travel or just relax on the beach on their holidays, but what if they own a pet such as a dog or a cat which they normally can't take with on their trip because either the airline rejects them or someone else.
But where to put their beloved animals during their holidays? Well, to this date mostly friends or relatives take them which is of course not done by everyone and it's difficult, because people need to ask them, teach how to feed, treat them etc.
\end{explanation}
\pagebreak

\section{Initial Situation}
\begin{explanation}
The current situation we are experiencing right now is that there are several websites where people can rent services, but no explicitly for the purpose of getting care for the pets.
Our product strives to prodvide an exclusive offer for people searching for babysitting for their beloved pets.
\end{explanation}
\pagebreak

\section{General Conditions and Constraints}
As people sign up to our service, their sensitive data needs to be securely stored, so no one without permissions cant access them.
\begin{itemize}
\item The user data must be secured.
\item The GUI of the information system must be intuitive.
\item The application should collect only data it only needs.
\item Backup's are mandatory
\item Different languages should be implemented
\item Verification of sellers should be done
\item Payment needs to be secured
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak

\section{Project Objectives and System Concepts}
\begin{explanation}
It's very important that we keep the application tidy and clean. We also need to provide a simple experience for users.
\end{explanation}

\begin{itemize}
\item People can sign up to the service 
\item Later on they are asked if they want to provide care or need care for their pets
\item People will not be able to care for the pets without having a trusted confirmation from the website. Which means they will be tested and checked whether it is safe to bring your pet to their place.
\item Then they need to submit their area and the maximum distance they should get suggestions
\item If the users finds someone he would like to hand over his pet, a chat can be started
\item Payment will be handled via the app.
\item To not get scammed, the funds will stay on hold till the buyer confirmed them.
\item When finished, a review can be written. There is no way to write a review without actually buying the service of the provider.
\end{itemize}

\section{Opportunities and Risks}
\begin{explanation}

\end{explanation}
\linebreak
Following opportunities could happen
\begin{itemize}
\item People are more relaxed with finding care for their pets
\item As the project rises, more and more people will use this service
\item The quality will increase
\end{itemize}

The following problems could happen
\begin{itemize}
\item Exploiting of the payment System
\item Database leaks
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak
\section{Planning}
\begin{explanation}
This is a rough example of things resources we need to develop and create this service
\end{explanation}
\begin{itemize}
\item The project will end on 15th June 2022
\item The project starts on 31st October 2021
\item The first prototype will be available in roughly 1 month
\item When does implementation work start?
\item Big chunks of work is the backend and the database handling
\item The work is doable in some months
\item We need 1 or 2 servers which handle the requests and databases
\end{itemize}
