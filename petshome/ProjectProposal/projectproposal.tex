\section{Introduction}
\begin{explanation}
It's a matter of fact that people like to travel or just relax on the beach on their holidays, but what if they own a pet such as a dog or a cat which they normally can't take with on their trip because either the airline rejects them or someone else.
But where to put their beloved animals during their holidays? Well, to this date mostly friends or relatives take them which is of course not done by everyone and it's difficult, because people need to ask them, teach how to feed, treat them etc.
\end{explanation}

\section{Initial Situation}
\begin{explanation}
The current situation we are experiencing right now is that there are several websites where people can rent services, but no explicitly for the purpose of getting care for the pets.
Our product strives to prodvide an exclusive offer for people searching for babysitting for their beloved pets.
\end{explanation}

\section{General Conditions and Constraints}
As the security of the data is very important we will plan to use a database where all the hashed sensitive information will be stored.
\newline
Not everyone is familiar with the new technology therefore we will try to aim for a easy and smooth Interface which will give you the opportunity
to get as fast and easy as possible to certain information.
\newline
In order to keep all the data safe we will use proper backups. The user will be able to choose his/her prefered language to get an easier overview.
\newline
All sellers which will take care of your pet must be verified.
\newline
The App will also offer a overview with all your pets that ypu are taking care of. That means that every pet will have a small characteristics. 
Also the seller will get notification for special pets which need certain medicine or dont tolerate some food types. 
\newline
Lastly the almost most important thing must be as secure as possible which is the payment. Thefore we will use a safe payment system such as Stripe.

\section{Project Objectives and System Concepts}
\begin{explanation}
It's very important that we keep the application tidy and clean. We also need to provide a simple experience for users.
\newline
After downloading the app, users need to make an account, or can otherwise sign in if they already have one.
\newline
For simpilicity we tend to use Google SignUp Services, so people can just use their Google account in order to use the service.
\newline
After this process the app will ask if the user wants to provide care or needs care.
\newline
If they want to provide help, users need to go through a verification process in order to prevent abuse for example: misstreating the pet, not providing adequate care etc..
\newline
After this verification the users can either issue an advertisement or search for offers. It should also be possible to filter offers depending on the city or on the distace.
\newline
If an offer is found, the chat function can be used to get in touch with the person. Later on the payment can be made.
\newline
To prevent fraud, the funds will be held until the user confirms his satisfaction.
\newline
After that a review about the service can be made.
\end{explanation}
\section{Opportunities and Risks}
\begin{explanation}
This project is a really useful for every pet owner and could get a major place for pet care in the future.
\newline
If the userbase increases, users might experience a poor low loading perfomance and might search for a new service because ours doesn't function correctly anymore.
\end{explanation}

\section{Planning}
\begin{explanation}
We've set ourselfs the following milestones 
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
Milestones \\ \hline
Setting up the environment \\ \hline
Designing the GUI \\ \hline

Release a first major version \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}
The right hardware is also an essential thing needed.
\newline
We need a server in order to handle REST function, a database to organize everything for example Orders, Users etc.
\newline
The app is planned to be written using Java and AndroidStudio and will be released for Android Devices.
\end{explanation}
